        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"

    <string name="introlecturedescription">2 to 3 lectures will be released every week.\nThere are In-Class Quizzes, Assignments, Notes along with Lecture Videos in a lecture.\nYou should attempt them all to master each section that you study.\nYou should complete the lectures within the week.</string>
    <string name="introassignmentdecription">After almost every lecture there will be one assignment.\nAssignments will have deadlines. Submissions after deadline will be subject to penalty (Penalty procedure is explained separately).\nApart from assignments there will be frequent tests analysing your concepts and understanding.</string>
    <string name="introdoubtsdescription">Apart from instructors taking the course, there are teaching assistants in the course who will be taking your doubts.\nYou can ask doubt on any content that you are facing problem at, be it a video or a question.\nThere is an “Ask Doubt” button on the top right corner to raise your doubt.\nFor doubt resolution TA support will be available between 6PM evening till 12AM midnight, on all seven days.</string>
    <string name="introsolutiondescription">For many assignment problems, there are hint videos which you can watch. Watching them won\'t add any penalty.\nYou can watch solution videos also for some problems and can check the solution code. But after checking/watching the solution, further submissions to that question will not fetch you any marks.</string>
    <string name="intropenaltydescription">For every Assignment, there is a soft deadline which is mentioned in every assignment. That is - if you submit problems in your assignment within the soft deadline of its release, you can get the full score for problems (if all the testcases for the problem are passed).\nFor next 10 days (after deadline), a penalty of 25% will be applied on your problem submissions i.e. maximum score that you can get is 0.75*total_score.\nFor next 5 days a penalty of 50% will be applied on your submission, so maximum possible score for a problem will be 0.5*total_score. And after that, you won’t get any marks for your submissions.</string>
    <string name="introavailablitydescription">Lecture Videos in the course will be accessible by for next five weeks from the release date of the last lecture of the course.\nHint/Solution Videos, quizzes, questions within a lecture, assignments and notes are available to you for lifetime.</string>
    <string name="introleadeboaddescription">All the lecture questions, quizzes and assignments are graded. Submissions after deadlines will be penalised as per the penalty scheme specified above.\nUnder “Your Percentage Score” you can see your \'With\' and \'Without\' penalty score. \"With penalty score\" is your final score considered for leaderboard and certificates.\n“Without penalty score” is your score without any penalties applied to the score, which just indicates your total progress in the course.\nA leaderboard is maintained for the batch which you can see under overview section in your course. Based on your score you can check your class rank.</string>
    <string name="introcertificatedescription"><![CDATA[After the module ends all those students whose “With Penalty Score” >= 60% will be awarded course certificates.\nYou will have to fill in your details for the certificate. Option to fill certificates details is right below “Resume to Classroom”.\nAfter the course ends, you will see an option to download your certificate right below “Resume to Classroom”.]]></string>
    <string name="introendnotedescription">Ultimately, PRACTICE IS THE KEY!\nThe more you practice, better will be the results. Also, avoid missing lectures.\nWe wish all the best in this journey of codes! Keep coding :)]</string>
